# release

Builds the branches needed for a framework release.

This tool is meant to help automate the process of
launching a new release, by creating the release
distribution files, (tagging everything properly), 
and getting/keeping the repo branches in order.

## Audience

This script is intended for use by framework maintainers,
i.e. someone with commit rights on the CI4 repository.

You will be prompted for your github credentials and
GPG-signing key as appropriate.

## Workflow

The repo has two branches of interest: "master" (stable) and "develop" (in progress).
There might be other feature branches, but they are not relevant to this process.

Once "develop" is ready for a new release, the general workflow is to

- create a "release" branch from develop
- update version dependencies or constants
- generate version(s) of the user guide
- move or ignore stuff, distinguishing release from development
- test that all is as it should be
- merge the release branch into "master"
- **manually** create the release & tag on github, based on master
- put everything back where it should be for development
- merge the post-release branch into "master"
- merge the post-release branch into "develop"
- **manually** delete the release branches in the repo
- **manually** post a sticky announcement thread on the forum
- **manually** tweet the release announcement

Visually:

    develop -> release -> master
    post-release -> master
    post->release  -> develop

The `release` bash script does the first six workflow steps,
and the `post-release` script does the other three between
the manual steps.

## Assumptions

You (a maintainer) have forked the main CodeIgniter4 repo,
and the git alias `origin`, in your local clone, refers to your fork. 
The script creates an additional alias, `upstream`, which refers to the 
main repo. This separation keeps the release branch isolated
for any testing you want to do.

The `develop` branch of the main repo should be "clean", and ready for
a release. This means that the changelog and upgrading instructions
have been suitably edited.

This script is not intended to deal with hotfixes, i.e. PRs against
`master` that need to also be merged into `develop`, probably
as part of a bug fix minor release.

## Usage

Inside a shell prompt, in the project root:

    `admin/release version [qualifier]`

Nothing is pushed to the repo. at this point -
the results are left inside
the release branch in your local clone.

The "version" should follow semantic versioning, e.g. `4.0.6`, and the
version number should be higher than the current released one.

The "qualifier" argument is a suffix to add to the version
for a pre-release, e.g. `beta.2` or `rc.41`.

Examples:
- `admin/release 4.0.0 alpha.1` would prepare the "4.0.0-alpha.1" pre-release PR
- `admin/release 4.0.0` would prepare the "4.0.0" release PR
- `admin/release peanut butter banana` would complain and tell you to read these directions

Complete the next few steps of the release manually:
- merge the release branch to "master"
- push that to the main repo
- on github.com, create an appropriate release (or pre-release)

Once the release branch has been vetted, and you have
completed the manual steps, clean up with:

    `admin/post_release version [qualifier]`
